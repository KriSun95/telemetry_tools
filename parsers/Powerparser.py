    Parse ADC measurements of voltage and current into a `dict`.

    Paramaters
    ----------
    data : `bytes`
        A raw data frame output by the Housekeeping board. Raw data is 6 bytes 
        of header data, followed by 16 2-byte long samples concatenated 
        (38 bytes total, or a multiple of 38).
        Data is taken from the AD7490 multiplexed ADC: 
        https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad7490.html.
        First 4 bits are channel number. Next 12 bits are raw data for that channel.

    Returns
    -------
    `dict` : 
        A dictionary mapping `int` channel number into `float` measured value. The 
        first 4 entries (keys `0` through `3`) are voltages (unit V); the remainder  
        are currents (unit A).
